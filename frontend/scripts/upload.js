1. Define event listeners for the file input and upload button elements.\n2. When a file is selected, validate the file type and size.\n3. On clicking the upload button, use FormData to package the file and send an AJAX request to the backend API endpoint.\n4. Handle the response from the server: if successful, display a success message and the option to download the CSV. If an error occurs, display an appropriate error message to the user.\n5. Implement additional handlers for UI feedback during the upload process, such as progress bars or loading indicators.
