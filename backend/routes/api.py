1. Import necessary libraries like Pytesseract for OCR processing and PIL or OpenCV for image loading.
2. Preprocess the image for OCR accuracy by converting to grayscale, resizing, and adjusting contrast.
3. Apply OCR using Pytesseract to extract text from the preprocessed image.
4. Clean and format the extracted text to remove unwanted characters or spaces.
5. Pass the cleaned text to the csv_generator module for CSV data generation.
